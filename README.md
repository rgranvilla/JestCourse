# Testing React with Jest and Testing Library

React Testing Library has become an extremely popular option for testing React, and with good reason! This detailed, comprehensive course provides a solid foundation for React app tests.

## Best Practices

React Testing Library is famously opinionated about testing best practices, and is written to encourage these best practices. This course teaches:

- testing behavior over testing implementation
- tests that interact with your app the way a user would
- finding elements by accessibility handles, to make sure your code is accessible as possible

## Broad range of testing examples

The course apps start very with very simple examples (clicking a button to change its color) and work up to progressively more complicated testing concepts, such as:

- testing asynchronous page changes
- simulating data from a server using Mock Service Worker
- applying a context provider to a component when rendering

The course builds up to complex concepts gradually, in a way designed to support your learning and ensure your success.

## Practice your new skills

You will also have plenty of opportunities to practice what you’ve learned. The course provides "code quizzes" while building the course projects, where you can apply what you learned and then watch a video to see the solution. The (optional) final section provides even more exercises to complete the second app and reinforce concepts from the course.

## Optional React lectures

Any significant React code covered in the course is isolated into separate lectures. Students have a choice: those who want to reinforce their React skills (or learn new ones!) can watch those lectures, while students who feel confident in their React skills can skip them.

## Supportive Instructor

The instructor has a proven track record of responding to course Q&A in a helpful and supportive way. She loves to engage with students, answer questions about course concepts, and help debug students' code for the course projects.
